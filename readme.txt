This is a 'website' I made in my webpage programming class. It is about my favorite music artists at the time. 
I used css and html to make it and used adobe fireworks to make image maps that link to the artists' website.
If you want to see it you'll have to link the images ("Left_Graphic" & "top_image") in the index_Nguyen file.
